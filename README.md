This repository contains a C# solution for two main functionalities:

## 1. Clock Angle Calculation
This part of the solution calculates the angle between the hour and minute hands of a clock based on user input.

### Key Components:
- **ClockAngleService**: A service that computes the angle between the clock's hands.
- **Input/Output**: The user provides the hour and minute, and the program outputs the calculated angle in degrees.


## 2. Shapes Solution
This part of the solution focuses on creating and manipulating geometrical shapes (Circle and Rectangle).

### Key Components:
- Generates a collection of shapes (Circle and Rectangle) with specific rules:
  Shapes are randomly selected.
  Each shape's perimeter matches its position in the collection (e.g., shape at index 2 has a perimeter of 3).
- Calculates the total sum of circle perimeters in the collection.
